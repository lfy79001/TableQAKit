According to the table, the Bell Wireless operating revenues in Q4 2018 is $2,637 million.   Sixth, we need to calculate the Bell Wireless operating revenues in Q4 2019. We can do this by multiplying the Bell Wireless operating revenues in Q4 2018 by 1.036 (3.6% increase). This gives us a Bell Wireless operating revenues in Q4 2019 of $2,731 million.   Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of Bell Wireless out of the Total BCE operating revenues in Q4 2019. We can do this by dividing the Bell Wireless operating revenues in Q4 2019 by the Total BCE operating revenues in Q4 2019. This gives us a percentage of 39.3%.   Therefore, the answer to the question is 39.3%.
