The school 's initial service area was focused solely on the local Macon community , but expanded in 1990 when the school , then named Macon Technical Institute , assumed control of the Baldwin County Adult Center in Milledgeville . The Georgia General Assembly approved funding for a full campus to be constructed in Milledgeville in 1993 , and construction of the facility was completed in Fall 1997 . The school 's current service area was formally expanded to its current size on July 6 , 2000 , as part of the Education Reform Act in Georgia . This act also renamed the school to its current form . After passage of this act , the school built learning centers in the remaining five counties of its seven-county service area . On September 26 , 2012 , the State Board of the Technical College System of Georgia voted to merge Central Georgia Technical College and Middle Georgia Technical College.The merger of the colleges created one of the largest two-year colleges in Georgia , with an 11 county service delivery area larger than the state of Delaware .

United States [DOT] Thermosphaeroma thermophilum , commonly known as the Socorro isopod or Socorro sowbug , is a crustacean in the family Sphaeromatidae . It was endemic to the thermal water of Sedillo Spring located in Socorro County in the state of New Mexico , United States . In the isopod 's natural habitat the thermal waters ranged in temperature from 26-33 °C ( 79-91 °F ) . In 1947 , when the spring was diverted to supply the city of Socorro with drinking water , the isopods ended up living in an old water supply pipe that led to a horse trough and two small , old , concrete bathing pools . In 1988 , the wild population became extinct when a tree root burst the pipe and cut off water flow to the concrete pools . Existing captive populations were bred to restore the isopod community near the spring and they were reintroduced into eight new concrete pools ( tanks ) . As of 2006 , captive populations are kept at the Albuquerque Biological Park , the Minnesota Zoo , the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Laboratory in Santa Fe , and by the Department of Biology at New Mexico Tech .

ballad-heavy music of the present day , with varying degrees of easy listening , pop , soul , rhythm and blues , quiet storm , and rock influence . Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music . Adult contemporary tends to have lush , soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated . It is usually melodic enough to get a listener 's attention , and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music . Like most of pop music , its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure . The format is heavy on romantic sentimental ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments ( though bass guitar is usually used ) such as acoustic guitars , pianos , saxophones , and sometimes an orchestral set . The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched . However , recent adult contemporary music may feature synthesizers ( and other electronics , such as drum machines ) . An AC radio station may play mainstream music , but it excludes hip hop , dance tracks , hard rock , and some forms of teen pop , as these are less popular among adults , the target demographic .

2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships [DOT] Status is Continental [DOT] Winner/s is Russia [DOT] Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running , jumping , throwing , and walking . The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field , road running , cross country running , and race walking . The results of racing events are decided by finishing position ( or time , where measured ) , while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts .

Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics , the global governing body for the sport of athletics , or its member continental and national federations . The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics . The foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships , which incorporates track and field , marathon running and race walking . Other top level competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the World Half Marathon Championships . Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics Championships .

143 Squadron RAF [DOT] Starting from is 11 June 1942 [DOT] Ending on is 27 July 1942 [DOT] Aircraft is Hawker Hurricane [DOT] Notes is Used the airfield for just over six weeks [DOT] No . 143 Squadron RAF was a Royal Air Force Squadron formed as a fighter unit in the First World War and reformed as an RAF Coastal Command fighter and anti-submarine unit in Second World War . [DOT] The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s-40s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for service with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the Supermarine Spitfire 's role during Battle of Britain in 1940 , but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the Luftwaffe in the engagement , and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War . The Hurricane originated from discussions between RAF officials and aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm about a proposed monoplane derivative of the Hawker Fury biplane in the early 1930s . Despite an institutional preference for biplanes and lack of interest from the Air Ministry , Hawker refined their monoplane proposal , incorporating several innovations which became critical to wartime fighter aircraft , including retractable landing gear and the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . The Air Ministry ordered Hawker 's Interceptor Monoplane in late 1934 , and the prototype Hurricane K5083 performed its maiden flight on 6 November 1935 . In June 1936 , the Hurricane went into production for the Air Ministry ; it entered squadron service on 25 December 1937 . Its manufacture and maintenance was eased by using conventional construction methods so that squadrons could perform many major repairs without external support . The Hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 , when the RAF had 18
